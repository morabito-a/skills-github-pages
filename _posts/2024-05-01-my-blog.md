ESG has emerged as a comprehensive framework to assess a company's sustainability and responsible business practices. ESG goes a step further than the broader concept of sustainability and represents a more targeted approach to evaluating specific aspects of a company's performance and impact.

In essence, while sustainability is a holistic concept that reflects the harmonization of economic,
environmental and social dimensions, ESG provides a more focused lens to evaluate a company's environmental responsibility, social impacts and governance practices.
Embracing ESG considerations not only allows companies to enhance their transparency and accountability but also helps investors and stakeholders make more informed decisions aligned with their values and long-term sustainability goals.
